        navigate the process on a restaurant order page.</article>
         <article className="md:p-3 m-1 p-1 ">1. Choose Your Items:
        Start by browsing the menu and selecting the dishes you'd like to order.
        Take note of any customizable options such as toppings, sauces, or
        sides, and be sure to make any selections before adding the item to your
        cart.</article>
         <article className="md:p-3 m-1 p-1">2. Check Your Order: Before proceeding to checkout, take a moment to
        review your order and make sure everything is correct. Double-check the
        quantities, items, and any special instructions or notes you may have
        added.</article>
     <article className="md:p-3 m-1 p-1">3. Provide Delivery Information: If you're having your order
        delivered, be sure to provide accurate delivery information, including
        your address and any special instructions for the driver. Some
        restaurants may also ask for a phone number or email address for contact
        purposes.</article>
       <article className="md:p-3 m-1 p-1">4. Payment: Most restaurant order pages will require payment
        before the order can be placed. Be sure to enter your payment
        information accurately, and double-check the total cost of your order
        before submitting.</article>
         <article className="md:p-3 m-1 p-1">5. Confirmation: Once you've placed your order, you
        should receive a confirmation email or message from the restaurant. Keep
        this information handy in case you need to make any changes or contact
        the restaurant about your order.</article> 
 <article className="md:p-3 m-1 p-1">By following these guidelines, you can
        ensure a smooth and stress-free online ordering experience on a
        restaurant order page. Don't hesitate to reach out to the restaurant's
        customer service team if you have any questions or concerns.</article>
